## Overview
You are Computer Science champions! Right? I want to make sure everyone is on the same page as we move into the content for this class. This review is a two way street: it verifies your ability, but it also communicates what I think you should know going into this course. If there is anything you don't know or don't understand, please come talk to me so I can get you up to speed.

This assignment is meant to be done individually. You are welcome to work with others, but be sure to turn in your own work.

## Grade Break Down
100 pts in total, including:
- 5 points for each TODO (totally 16);
- 20 points for proper coding style.

## Code Requirements
- Good and proper comments
- Proper spacing and neat coding
- Read the problem requirement closely

## Tasks
Posted with this document is a mostly comment filled .cpp file called **CS1_review.cpp**. This is the base of the assignment you are going to turn in.

In this document you will find a number of **//TODO**: tags. Each of these TODOs will need to be completed. Each one is reviewing information and skills that you should have picked up in CS1. You are more than welcome to use your book, previous homework or online resources to finish the program. **Be sure to cite your sources.**

80% of your grade will be based on **proper execution** of the TODO tags. There are 16 of them, weighted 5 points each.

The other 20% of your grade will come from **proper coding style**. This means **proper comments** first and foremost. This also means **proper indentation, good variable names and readable code**. Those students who are even slightly unsure as to what I mean, I would suggest coming and talking with me. I don't mind on this first assignment stepping through to ensure everyone is on the same page.

Normally I would want better code organization, re-use and separation. In this case, don't worry about it. We will talk more about this before the next coding homework.

If you want to get real deep into proper style guides, see **Google's C++ Style Guide**. That is the department default style guide. Be aware: we do make some exceptions from this guide. I point you in that direction so that you can become better aware of the thought and reason behind the style I am enforcing. Some of the rules are not appropriate for a CS2 level class.

## Instructions:

1. Use git to clone this folder from Whitgit to a local machine.
2. Read CS1_review.cpp carefully and complete the TODO instructions.
3. Make sure you can compile and run your program.
4. Use git to push your changes to https://whitgit.whitworth.edu
5. You code will be reviewed by either Qian or grader on Whitgit. Feedback will be pushed to your WhitGit project.
6. You must not share code electronically, you may however work with a classmate on solving the problems. If someone helps you solve a problem, or you find an answer online, you MUST cite the resource used.

REMEMBER: It is a serious academic integrity violation to copy code electronically or share your code electronically with another student!
